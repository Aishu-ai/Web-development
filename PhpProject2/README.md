<h1 align="center">LifeStyle Store</h1>

<p>This project aims at developing a simple shopping website called the <b><i>Lifestyle Store</i></b> using HTML,Bootstrap,CSS,SQL and PHP. The design and the conditions needed for the website are given in the Problem Statment file.</p></br>
<p>The "common.php" file in the "includes" folder assists in connecting us to the database.(Here PHPmyAdmin is being used). The input to the "mysqli_connect" command varies according to your database. In the file the username and password to the database are 'debian-sys-maint' and '9Rs4JJEX4EvFzc7T' respectively.</p>
